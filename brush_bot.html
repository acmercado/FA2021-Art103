			<p> As our first soldering project, it was tedious work to be soldering such a small circuit. I kept messing up when it came to soldering wires onto the tiny switch. Using the breadboard and a clothespin to hold pieces in place weren't really helping me either. It actually helped more for the switch to be taped down onto a piece of cardboard, have it a bit elevated by another piece of cardboard, and have the wires taped down onto that cardboard so that it could easily be aligned with the pins of the switch. </p>

			<p> Getting the actual circuit to balance on the toothbrush head was surprisingly easy after it was hot glued on. However, finnesing the wires was a difficult decision of whether or not I wanted everything to be compact or try to make it look interesting, whilst hoping it's all balanced on top of the brush so that the brush doesn't flop over. Of course, I chose the second option because I wasn't sure if I was going to have enough time to make a "cover" that would hide the wires and enhance its appearance. </p>

			<p> Soldering everything onto the perf board was kind of confusing at first because although it's supposed to be similar to a breadboard, it isn't exactly the same. It wasn't until we added our "makeshift" rails, that it became easier to understand. However, one of my rails didn't work properly until I soldered most of it together (hence the long and fat soldering job on the bottom). I also decided to make a clothespin switch instead of the foam switch because in my opinion, it was more reliable for the circuit to actually turn on. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> Arranging the lights and circuit on the mask was a bit awkward, especially since we needed to have 7 LEDs in our circuit. I ended up putting 3 on each side for a symmetrical look, then putting the last one onto the perf board to act like a light to tell me that it's on and it's working. Having that "odd" LED in the middle also gave me a "Rudolph the 'GREEN'-nosed reindeer" look instead. As for the entire circuit itself, I decided to have it rest inside the mask so that I didn't risk any part of my circuit falling apart because it was dangling on the sides. I did, however, left the switch on the outside so that it would be easier to access. </p>
