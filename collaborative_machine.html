			<h3> “Aid in (Over-The-Shoulder) Blind Spots,” “ABS” for short. </h3>
			<center><p> - - - </p></center>
			<p> ABS excels in telling me if there is a car in my blind spot; at what speed a car is coming/moving; and how and when it would be safe to switch lanes. Since it only uses the side mirrors’ cameras, it does not know when a car is in front or behind the driver’s car. </p>
			<center><p> - - - </p></center>
			<p> As for myself, I excel at staying in my lane at the appropriate speed traffic is going and signaling for when I do need to switch lanes. Since I have been mostly inside for the past year and half due to COVID-19, I am terrible at looking over my shoulder for cars in my blindspot whilst trying to stay in the same lane. </p>

			<p> A day in the life of the “Aid in (Over-The-Shoulder) Blind Spots,” or “ABS” for short, begins when I, the driver, get in my car. ABS can effectively tell me if there is a car in my blind spots; at what speed a car is coming/moving; and how and when it would be safe to switch lanes. ABS is able to gather such information through the side mirrors’ cameras of my car and starts to verbally give information once I turn on my signal to go left or right. With its LED screen and the phone application it comes with, I am able to change the appearance and voice of ABS to whatever is my liking. In the settings of the application, I could also set whether I want ABS to help when I am in the city, on the highway, or both. </p>
			<center><p> - - - </p></center>
		 	<p> In a way, the relationship between ABS and I is mutualism because I benefit from knowing what are in my blind spots and when to switch lanes whereas ABS benefits from having a sense of “self-being” due to my customizations. However, this relationship could also be commensalism in the sense that ABS does not benefit from anything and is not harmed in the relationship. I, on the other hand, would be the only one benefiting from the relationship. </p>
